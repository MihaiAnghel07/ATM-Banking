Hello!

This is a mini project made during high school and which I discovered now. 
It is a simulator of a bank ATM. I made some adjustments and I think 
it turned out pretty well. The program works in English but you can add 
as many languages without too many changes.

The program reads from a file the data about the card owner (name, IBAN, 
card pin and balance) and then starts the process.

Check the pin inserted with the one read from the file and if it is 
inserted 3 times incorrectly, the card will be "blocked" and the process 
will end. Otherwise the process is continued just like at any atm. If the 
client wants a receipt, the program generates a receipt that shows the
 order history and the account balance.
Finally, the balance in the read file changes.

So I think I managed to make a pretty good copy of an authentic atm.

The program was written and run with CodeBlocks.
Just run and have fun!
